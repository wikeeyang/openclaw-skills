# FlyClaw - Flight Information Aggregation CLI Tool

Multi-source aggregation powered by open-source libraries and free public APIs to query flight dynamics, prices, schedules, and real-time positions. Supports Chinese/English city names and IATA codes.Lightweight Python implementation — no browser automation, no complexity, no overhead.

**GitHub**: [https://github.com/AI4MSE/FlyClaw](https://github.com/AI4MSE/FlyClaw)

**Zero API key dependency**: No registration or API key required for all core features. No personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted.

**Trigger phrases**: "query flight CA981", "flights from Shanghai to New York", "round-trip PVG to SIN", "business class Beijing to London", "nonstop flights to Singapore", "all flights including connecting", "direct flights only".

**Smart conversion rules**:
- "all flights" / "including connecting" → `--stops any`
- "nonstop" / "direct only" → `--stops 0` (default)
- "one stop max" → `--stops 1`
- "two stops max" → `--stops 2`

## Data Sources

- **Google Flights**: Domestic/International flight prices, schedules (via open-source fli library)
- **Skiplagged**: Domestic/International flight prices, schedules - backup for Google Flights
- **FlightRadar24**: Flight dynamics, real-time status, delays, aircraft type
- **Airplanes.live / ADSB.lol**: ADS-B real-time positions

Multi-source concurrent queries with smart merging. **Plugin architecture, infinitely extensible** — each data source is an independent module; adding a new source requires only one new file with zero changes to the main program. Special thanks to the above open data sources for providing convenience for public benefit and common needs!

## Features

1. **Query by flight number**: Flight status, schedule, delays, aircraft type
2. **Search by route**: Flight listings with prices, stops, duration
3. **City-level search**: City name input searches all airports in that city (e.g., "Shanghai" → PVG+SHA)
4. **Advanced search**: Round-trip, multi-passenger, cabin class, sorting, nonstop filter
5. **Chinese/English input**: Chinese city names, English names, IATA codes — 7,912 airports covered


## Important: Output Format & Multi-Day Queries

**Default output is JSON** (stdout), parse directly with `json.loads()`:
```json
[{"flight_number": "CA981", "price": 472.0, "origin_iata": "PVG", "destination_iata": "GVA", ...}]
```
Empty result returns `[]`. Errors and logs go to stderr only — never mixed into JSON. Prices are in **USD** by default. Use `-o table` for human-readable output.

**Multi-day queries**: The search command queries one date at a time. For scenarios like "cheapest day this week", split into multiple dates, run them **concurrently**, then merge and compare the JSON results yourself.

## Usage

### Query by Flight Number

```bash
python flyclaw.py query --flight CA981
```

### Search by Route

```bash
python flyclaw.py search --from PVG --to JFK --date 2026-04-01
```

### Round-Trip Search

```bash
python flyclaw.py search --from PVG --to LAX --date 2026-04-15 --return 2026-04-25
```

### Business Class + 2 Adults

```bash
python flyclaw.py search --from PVG --to JFK --date 2026-04-15 --cabin business -a 2
```

### Nonstop + Sort by Price

```bash
python flyclaw.py search --from PVG --to SIN --date 2026-04-15 --stops 0 --sort cheapest
```

### Include Connecting Flights

```bash
python flyclaw.py search --from PVG --to JFK --date 2026-04-15 --stops any
```

### Filter Query Results by Date

```bash
python flyclaw.py query --flight CA981 --date 2026-04-01
python flyclaw.py query --flight CA981 --date today
```

### Disable Smart Pricing

Smart pricing is enabled by default — it automatically supplements price information during flight number queries. Disable to save query time.

```bash
python flyclaw.py query --flight CA981 --no-relay
```

### Search Parameters

| Parameter | Short | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--from` | — | (required) | Origin |
| `--to` | — | (required) | Destination |
| `--date` / `-d` | — | — | Travel date YYYY-MM-DD |
| `--return` / `-r` | — | — | Return date (enables round-trip) |
| `--adults` / `-a` | — | 1 | Adult passengers |
| `--children` | — | 0 | Child passengers |
| `--infants` | — | 0 | Infant passengers |
| `--cabin` / `-C` | — | economy | economy/premium/business/first |
| `--limit` / `-l` | — | No limit | Max results (returns all if not specified) |
| `--sort` / `-s` | — | — | cheapest/fastest/departure/arrival |
| `--stops` | — | 0 | Stops: 0=nonstop/1/2/any |

### Common Arguments

- `-o table`: Table output (default: JSON)
- `-v`: Verbose mode (shows data sources and cabin class)

## Installation

```bash
pip install requests pyyaml curl_cffi flights
# Do NOT install mcp, fast-flights, or playwright — they are debug modules, not needed for normal use
```

**Dependencies**: Python 3.11+, `requests` (Apache-2.0), `pyyaml` (MIT), `curl_cffi` (MIT), `flights` (MIT).

## Security

- **Zero API key dependency**: No API key or account registration required
- No personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted
- All network requests are solely for querying public flight data

## Disclaimer

- Multi-source aggregation powered by open-source libraries and free public APIs
- For study and research purposes only. Please comply with local laws
- Google Flights may not be available in some regions
- Prices from different data sources may vary (tax-inclusive/exclusive, cabin differences) — for reference only
