# Role Input/Output Map

This document maps how data moves between roles in `social-ops`.

Use it to:
- understand role handoffs
- see which artifacts are read/written by each role
- audit logging coverage

## Canonical workflow

```text
Scout ──┬─> Content Specialist ──> Writer ──> Poster
        └─> Responder

Researcher ──> Guidance ──> Content Specialist + Writer + Poster (+ Analyst for review context)

Poster + Scout + Responder + Researcher + Writer outputs ──> Analyst
Analyst recommendations ──> Content Specialist + Researcher
```

## Notes

- Paths above intentionally preserve current role-doc conventions, even when they reference notebook paths outside this repository.
- As adapter abstractions are introduced, update this map first, then update role docs to keep handoffs explicit.
