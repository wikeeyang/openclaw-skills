## Model Requirements

This skill has ~400 lines of instructions with multi-step branching flows. The AI model running it needs to reliably follow complex instructions.

| Tier | Models | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ✅ **Recommended** | Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5.x, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-Max, or equivalent flagship models | Full capability — follows all multi-step flows correctly |
| ⚠️ **Usable** | Claude Haiku 3.5, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Llama 3.1/3.3 70B+, DeepSeek-V2.5, Qwen-72B, GLM-4, Yi-Large, or similar mid-tier models | May simplify pre-generation or skip monitoring details |
| ❌ **Not recommended** | Llama 8B, Phi-3/4, Qwen-7B, ChatGLM-6B, Mistral 7B, or any model under ~30B parameters | Will miss critical safety steps — not safe for printer control |

> **Why it matters:** The skill has a strict pipeline: search → generate → analyze → repair → preview → open Bambu Studio → user slice & confirm → print → monitor. Small models tend to skip the analyze/preview steps, which can waste filament, damage prints, or in worst case harm the printer. When in doubt, use a recommended-tier model.

## Installation

**Via ClawHub (recommended):**
```bash
clawhub install bambu-studio-ai
```

**Manual:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heyixuan2/bambu-studio-ai.git ~/.agents/skills/bambu-studio-ai
pip3 install bambulabs-api bambu-lab-cloud-api requests trimesh numpy Pillow ddgs pygltflib cryptography paho-mqtt
```

**Optional but recommended (macOS):**
```bash
brew install --cask bambu-studio  # Model preview + slicing (macOS)
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 scripts/doctor.py          # Verify all dependencies
python3 scripts/search.py "vase"   # Search for models
python3 scripts/bambu.py status    # Check printer status
```

## Setup

> 💡 Run `python3 scripts/doctor.py` to verify all dependencies before first use.

No CLI wizard — your OpenClaw agent handles setup through conversation:

1. Tell your agent anything about printing (e.g., "check my printer")
2. Agent detects no config → walks you through setup:
   - **Printer model** (all 9 Bambu Lab models)
   - **Connection mode** (LAN recommended, Cloud for remote)
   - **AI 3D generation provider** (optional)
   - **Notification channel**
   - **Print monitoring intensity** (Light/Standard/Intensive/Off)
3. Agent runs verification tests (with your permission)
4. Done!

### LAN Setup (Recommended)

Your OpenClaw host and printer must be on the **same WiFi/network**.

On your printer's touchscreen:
1. **Settings → Network → LAN Mode → ON**
2. Note down: **IP Address**, **Serial Number**, **Access Code** (Settings → Device)

### Print Mode

**Option A: Manual Print (Recommended, Safe)**
- Agent generates model → opens in Bambu Studio → you slice, review, and print
- No special printer settings needed
- Bambu Studio and Bambu Handy continue working normally

**Option B: Full Auto-Print (Advanced)**
- Agent controls printer directly: start, stop, pause, monitor via LAN
- ⚠️ **Requires Developer Mode** — printer touchscreen → Settings → LAN Only → Developer Mode → ON
- ⚠️ Bambu Studio and Bambu Handy will **completely disconnect** (no cloud, no remote access)
- ⚠️ LAN-only: must be on the same network
- Agent still always shows preview and asks for confirmation before printing

### Cloud Setup (Remote Only)

Only use if you can't be on the same network. Limited features (no camera, no G-code, no AI monitoring).

First login requires email verification code. Token is cached for 90 days.

## The Full Pipeline

Here's what happens when you say "make me an iPhone 16 Pro Max case and print it":

```
You: "Print me an iPhone 16 Pro Max case"

Agent: "How would you like to get the model?               ← Ask preference
  1. 🔎 Search existing models
  2. 🎨 AI generate a custom one
  3. 🤷 Not sure"

User: "Not sure"

Agent: "Let me search first..."                            ← Search online
 → Searches Printables, MakerWorld, Thangs
Agent: "Found 3 options:                                   ← Present results
  1. ⭐ iPhone 16 PM Case (4.8★, 12K downloads)
  2. Slim Case with MagSafe
  3. Rugged Case with kickstand"

User: "None of these, generate one"

Agent: "A few questions:                                   ← Clarify requirements
  1. Material? TPU recommended (flexible)
  2. Features? (protection only / kickstand / card slot)
  3. Style preference?"

Agent: "Let me look up the exact dimensions..."            ← Research (with permission)
 → Searches iPhone 16 Pro Max specs
Agent: "159.9×76.7×8.25mm, camera bump 40×36mm            ← Confirm specs
  Adding 1mm tolerance, TPU material. OK?"

User: "OK"
                    ↓

                    ↓
Auto-repair if needed                                       ← Repair
"🔧 Fixed 58K non-manifold edges"
                    ↓
open -a "BambuStudio" phone_case.3mf                       ← Open in BS (MANDATORY)
Agent: "Opened in Bambu Studio. Please:                    ← User must verify + slice
  - Does the model look correct?
  - Any floating/disconnected parts?
  - Dimensions right?
  - Slice (Cmd+R) — check time, filament, supports
  Let me know when ready!"

User: "Looks good, print it"
                    ↓
bambu.py print phone_case.3mf                               ← Print
                    ↓

## Model Sourcing (Search vs Generate)

The agent always asks first: search existing models or AI generate?

### Online Model Libraries

| Source | URL | Best For |
|--------|-----|----------|
| **Printables** | printables.com | Bambu Lab community, pre-sliced profiles |
| **MakerWorld** | makerworld.com | Bambu Lab official, ready-to-print |
| **Thingiverse** | thingiverse.com | Largest library |
| **Thangs** | thangs.com | Search engine, aggregates multiple sites |
| **MyMiniFactory** | myminifactory.com | Curated, high quality |
| **Cults3D** | cults3d.com | Designer models |

### When to Search vs Generate

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Common object (phone stand, hook, organizer) | **Search** — 99% chance it exists, community-tested |
| Specific product accessory (iPhone case) | **Search first** — likely exists with exact dimensions |
| Custom/unique object | **Generate** |
| Mechanical/functional part | **Search** — tested designs > AI guesses |
| Artistic/decorative | **Search first**, generate if nothing fits |

---

## AI 3D Generation

### ⚠️ Important: About AI-Generated Model Quality

**The quality of generated 3D models depends primarily on two factors:**
1. **Your 3D generation API provider** — Meshy, Tripo3D, etc. each have different strengths
2. **The prompt** — more detailed = better results

**AI-generated models are NOT production-ready.** They are a starting point. Common issues:
- Non-manifold geometry (auto-repaired by analyze.py)
- Floating/disconnected parts
- Thin walls that break during printing
- Imprecise dimensions
- Missing fine details

**Always verify in Bambu Studio before printing.** The agent will remind you.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Text→3D | Image→3D | Output | Price | Quality |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Meshy** | ✅ | ✅ | GLB (auto→3MF) | Free + $20/mo | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Most mature |
| **Tripo3D** | ✅ | ✅ | GLB (auto→3MF) | Free + $10/mo | ⭐⭐⭐ Good value |
| **Printpal** | ✅ | ✅ | STL | Varies | ⭐⭐⭐ Print-optimized |
| **3D AI Studio** | ✅ | ✅ | STL/OBJ | Early access | ⭐⭐ New |

### Output Format Priority

Most AI providers return GLB, which Bambu Studio cannot open. The skill auto-converts:

| Step | Format | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Provider returns | GLB | That's what they output |
| Auto-convert to | **3MF** | Bambu Lab native format |
| Fallback | **STL** | If 3MF conversion fails |
| Also supported | **STEP/STP**, **OBJ** | For CAD editing or fallback |

### Smart Prompt Enhancement

Your prompt is automatically enhanced for 3D printing:

```
You say: "a phone stand"

Enhanced to: "a phone stand. Optimized for FDM 3D printing.
Maximum dimensions: 315x288x292mm. CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
Single connected piece (no floating parts), flat stable base,
all parts physically connected to base, watertight manifold mesh,
no overhangs beyond 45°, minimum 1.5mm wall thickness,
no thin features under 2mm. Printable without supports if possible."
```

Use `--raw` flag to skip enhancement if you've crafted your own prompt.

### Auto Size Limiting

Models are constrained to your printer's build volume (with 10% safety margin):

| Printer | Max Printable Dimensions |
|---------|------------------------|
| A1 Mini | 162×162×162mm |
| A1/P1S/P2S/X1C/X1E/H2C | 230×230×230mm |
| H2S | 306×288×306mm |
| H2D | 315×288×292mm |

---

## Model Analysis & Repair

Every model goes through an **11-point printability check** before printing:

| # | Check | What It Detects |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Dimensional tolerance | Missing +0.2mm clearance for mating parts |
| 2 | Wall thickness | Walls thinner than material minimum (1.2mm PLA, 1.6mm TPU, 2.0mm PEEK) |
| 3 | Load direction | Stress axis aligned with weak layer lines |
| 4 | Overhang detection | Faces >45° that need support material |
| 5 | Print orientation | No flat base = bad bed adhesion |
| 5b | **Floating parts** | Disconnected pieces that will fall during printing |
| 6 | Layer height | 0.12mm (detail), 0.20mm (default), 0.28mm (fast) |
| 7 | Infill rate | 15% decorative, 30% functional |
| 8 | Wall count | ≥3 standard, ≥4 functional parts |
| 9 | Top layers | ≥5 for clean top surface |
| 10 | Material compatibility | Checks if printer supports the material |
| + | Mesh quality | Watertight, manifold, build volume fit |

### Auto Repair

If mesh issues are found (non-manifold edges, holes, bad normals), the script automatically:
1. Fixes normals and winding
2. Fills holes
3. Removes degenerate/duplicate faces
4. Saves repaired version

For stubborn meshes that can't be auto-repaired:
- Bambu Studio: Right-click model → Fix Model
- Online: [Formware STL Repair](https://www.formware.co/onlinestlrepair)

### Score

Each model gets a **printability score out of 10**:
- 🟢 **8-10**: Ready to print
- 🟡 **5-7**: Review warnings, may need adjustments
- 🔴 **1-4**: Significant issues, fix before printing

---

## Print Monitoring

AI-powered anomaly detection with configurable intensity:

| Level | Interval | Token Cost | Best For |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| 🟢 **Light** | Every 30 min | ~2 tokens/hr | Long prints, budget-conscious |
| 🟡 **Standard** | Every 5 min | ~12 tokens/hr | Recommended default |
| 🔴 **Intensive** | Every 2 min | ~30 tokens/hr | Critical prints, new materials, first prints |
| ⚫ **Off** | — | 0 | When you're watching it yourself |

### What It Detects

| Issue | Severity | Automatic Action |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Stringing | ⚠️ Low | Log, continue, clean after |
| Warping | ⚠️ Medium | Shorten check interval, watch closely |
| Layer Shift | ❌ High | Notify + recommend pause |
| Bed Detachment | ❌ Critical | Auto-pause + immediate alert |
| Spaghetti (total failure) | ❌ Critical | Auto-pause + immediate alert |
| Nozzle Clog | ❌ Critical | Auto-pause + alert |

### How It Works

```
monitor.py takes camera snapshot
        ↓
Agent analyzes image with vision AI
        ↓
Normal → log, continue
Suspicious → shorten interval
Critical → auto-pause + notify user
```

Requires **LAN mode** (camera access) and **user consent** (agent always asks before enabling).

## How We Handle AI-Generated Model Shadows

AI 3D models have baked lighting in textures. Instead of removing shadows (fragile), we **bypass them**: HSV classification groups pixels by hue, which is unaffected by shadows (shadows change brightness, not hue).

<details>
<summary>📖 Technical Deep Dive</summary>


AI 3D generation services (Tripo, Meshy, etc.) bake lighting directly into model textures. A "black" character body might actually be RGB(58,59,63) — dark gray with baked ambient occlusion. Traditional approaches try to *remove* these shadows (delight/albedo extraction), but this is fragile and introduces artifacts.

### Our Approach: Classify First, Color Later

Instead of fighting baked lighting, we **bypass it entirely** with pixel-level color family classification:

```
Traditional (v1-v3, abandoned):
  Texture → [Remove shadows] → CIELAB match to 43 Bambu colors → Material OBJ
  Problem: shadow removal is imperfect → false colors at boundaries

v4 (current):
  Texture → [Classify pixels by HSV family] → [Greedy select by area] → [CIELAB assign] → Vertex-color OBJ
  Key insight: shadows don't change HUE, only VALUE — HSV classification is shadow-immune
```

**Why it works:** A baked shadow on a red surface makes it darker red (lower V), but it's still *red* (same H). HSV family classification groups all reds together regardless of brightness. The shadow pixels get assigned to the "red" family alongside the bright pixels, and the representative color (median) naturally reflects the true material color.

### Pipeline Steps

| Step | What | Time |
|------|------|------|
| 1. Extract texture | pygltflib parses GLB binary (no Blender) | <1s |
| 2. Classify pixels | Each of ~4M pixels → HSV → 12 color families | <1s |
| 3. Greedy select | Largest family → median color → exclude family group → repeat (≤8) | <1s |
| 4. Per-pixel assign | Every pixel → CIELAB distance → nearest selected color | 2-3s |
| 5. Quantize texture | Build N-color PNG + preview | <1s |
| 6. Vertex colors | Blender: subdivide → UV sample → sRGB→linear → vertex color → OBJ | 1-2min |

### Color Family Groups (mutual exclusion)

When a family is selected, its partner is excluded to prevent wasting color slots:

| Group | Families | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Dark | black ↔ dark_gray | Mickey's body: all dark pixels → one slot |
| Light | light_gray ↔ white | Gloves/face highlights → one slot |
| Warm | orange ↔ yellow | Shoes: gold/brown → one slot |
| Red | red ↔ pink | Shorts + skin tones → one slot |
| Cool | green ↔ cyan | Patrick's shorts → one slot |
| Blue | blue ↔ purple | Decorative patterns → one slot |

### Why Not Remove Shadows?

We tried three shadow removal approaches before abandoning them all:

1. **AO Delight** (v0.11-0.18): Bake ambient occlusion → divide texture by AO → "remove" shadows. Problem: division amplifies noise, creates false bright spots, dark filament colors get washed out.

2. **Intrinsic Albedo Extraction** (v0.19-0.22): Cycles EMIT bake → pure material color without lighting. Problem: subtle color shifts from texture filtering, brightness stretch introduces hue drift.

3. **Zero Processing** (experiment): Map raw texture directly to Bambu colors. Result: surprisingly good — proved the complex pipelines were hurting more than helping. But still limited to 43 Bambu colors.

**Conclusion:** The problem was never "how to remove shadows" — it was "how to classify colors *despite* shadows." HSV family classification solves this because shadows affect V (value/brightness) but not H (hue). No delight, no albedo extraction, no shadow-aware mapping. Just classify and assign.

## Version History

| Version | Changes |
|---------|--------|
| **0.22.24** | colorize: fix smooth loop bug (was hardcoded 5 passes, now respects `--smooth`); `cleanup_labels` protects largest component per color (salient small region guard — eyes/buttons no longer erased); fix `--min-pct` help text. generate: stronger prompt enhancement with geometry-type detection (functional/figurine/general), keyword rewriting for problematic terms (smoke/flames/wisps → solid sculptural forms), `refine_prompt_for_retry()` helper; post-download connectivity check warns on disconnected parts with actionable fix hints. analyze: overhang messages now include absolute area (cm²) for context; minor mesh issues (holes + normals) auto-repaired by default without `--repair` flag (low-risk); `--no-auto-repair` opt-out added; disconnected-parts message links to concrete fixes. |
