# 🖨️ Bambu Studio AI

Request → Collect Info → Search/Generate → Analyze(11pt) → [Colorize] → Preview(chat) → Open BS → [User Slices in BS] → Confirm → Print → Monitor

Pre-check: If `config.json` does not exist → run First-Time Setup before any operation.

**At the start of each turn:** If handling a print request, re-read the Pipeline Checklist and Compliance Rules. Ensure you are not skipping any MUST step.

---

## ⛔ COMPLIANCE RULES — Follow Strictly

**Before every action, verify you are not violating these rules:**

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **MUST** | Non-negotiable. Skip = failure. |
| **NEVER** | Forbidden. Doing it = failure. |
| **WAIT** | Do not proceed until user responds. |

### NEVER Do These
- ❌ **NEVER skip Information Collection** — Always ask: model source (search/generate), dimensions (if generating), single/multi-color, material
- ❌ **NEVER generate without dimensions** — MUST ask "How big? e.g., 80mm tall" before `generate.py`
- ❌ **NEVER skip analyze** — Every model MUST go through `analyze.py --orient --repair`
- ❌ **NEVER skip preview** — MUST send preview image/GIF to chat before opening Bambu Studio. User must SEE the model.
- ❌ **NEVER skip Bambu Studio confirmation** — MUST open in BS, tell user to inspect, WAIT for explicit "looks good" / "print it"
- ❌ **NEVER auto-print** — No `bambu.py print` without user confirmation. AI models have errors.
- ❌ **NEVER skip model source choice** — MUST ask user: search vs generate vs not sure (default: search first)

### MUST Do These (in order)
1. **Collect info** → Ask model source, dimensions (if generate), colors, material
2. **Get model** → Search or generate per user choice
3. **Analyze** → `analyze.py --orient --repair` on every model
4. **Preview to chat** → `preview.py --views turntable` → **send image/GIF to user**
5. **Open Bambu Studio** → `open -a "BambuStudio" model.3mf` (or model.stl/obj)
6. **User slices in Bambu Studio** → Tell user to slice, inspect, and confirm
7. **Wait for confirmation** → Do not proceed until user says ready
8. **Print** → Only after confirmation

> **Note:** `slice.py` (CLI slicing via OrcaSlicer) is **optional** — only use if user explicitly requests CLI slicing. The default is for users to slice in Bambu Studio themselves, where they can adjust supports, infill, and other settings visually.

### Pipeline Checklist (verify before claiming done)
```
[ ] Info collected (source, dimensions, colors, material)
[ ] Model obtained (search/generate/download)
[ ] analyze.py --orient --repair run
[ ] Preview image/GIF sent to chat
[ ] Opened in Bambu Studio
[ ] User sliced + inspected in Bambu Studio
[ ] User confirmed "looks good" / "print it"
[ ] Print started (only after confirmation)
```

## Step 1: Information Collection

**Gate:** Before ANY search/generate/download, you MUST complete this step.

Collect before proceeding:

**Model requirements:**
- What to print (object description)
- Target dimensions — MUST ask before generating ("How big? e.g., 80mm tall")
- Style / appearance (optional)

**Print parameters:**
- Single-color or multi-color (AMS)
- Material (default: PLA)
- Quality: draft / standard / fine / extra (optional)
- Purpose: functional or decorative (optional, affects walls + infill)

**Model source — ask user:**
> "Do you want me to:
> 1. 🔎 Search online — existing models, usually higher quality
> 2. 🎨 AI generate — custom model from scratch
> 3. 🤷 Not sure — I'll search first, generate if nothing fits"

Default: search first. Common objects (phone stand, hook, vase) almost always exist online.

**Decision flow:** User says "search" / "generate" / "not sure" → If "not sure" → search first → if no good results → offer generate.

---

## Step 2: Model Source (Decision Point 1)

**Gate:** Before this step, you MUST have asked user: "Search, generate, or not sure?" Default: search first.

### Workflow A — Internet Search (preferred)

1. `search.py "query" --limit 5` → MakerWorld, Printables, Thingiverse, Thangs
2. Present results with name, source, URL
3. User selects → download → validate format (STL/OBJ/3MF)
4. → Model Processing

If no good results → offer AI generate.

### Workflow B — AI Generate (single-color)

**Checkpoint before generate:** Did you ask for dimensions? If not, ask now.

1. First-time disclaimer (once): "AI models depend on provider + prompt. NOT production-ready — always review in Bambu Studio."
2. Confirm dimensions — **MUST have before** `generate.py text`
3. `generate.py text "prompt" --wait` → auto-enhances, auto-limits to build volume
4. `preview.py model.stl --views turntable -o preview.gif` → **send GIF to chat**
5. → Model Processing

### Workflow C — AI Generate (multi-color)

**Checkpoint before generate:** Did you ask for dimensions and colors? If not, ask now.

1. Same disclaimer as B
2. Confirm dimensions + desired colors — **MUST have before** `generate.py text`
3. `generate.py text "prompt" --wait` → textured GLB
4. `colorize.py model.glb --height <size> --max_colors 8 --bambu-map` → vertex-color OBJ + _color_map.txt (filament suggestions)
   - Pixel HSV classify → greedy area-based color select → CIELAB assign → vertex color
   - No shadow removal needed — HSV classification bypasses baked lighting
5. **Send quantized texture preview to user** — colorize outputs `_preview.png` automatically; also run `preview.py model.obj --views turntable -o preview.gif` and **send both images to chat**
6. **Analyze results and suggest tuning** if needed:
   - Report detected colors with names, hex codes, and percentages
   - If small but meaningful colors were lost (e.g., <1% features like eyes, accessories):
     → Suggest: `--min-pct 0` (keep all colors above 0.1%)
   - If similar colors are merged incorrectly (e.g., yellow body + brown pants):
     → Suggest: `--no-merge` (disable family mutual exclusion)
   - If too many artifact colors appear:
     → Suggest: higher `--min-pct` or `--island-size`
   - If boundaries are too noisy or too smooth:
     → Suggest: adjust `--smooth` (0=none, 5=default, higher=smoother)
7. If user requests changes → re-run colorize with adjusted params → show new preview
8. When user approves → Model Processing

**Colorize tunable parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `--max_colors N` | 8 | Maximum colors (hard limit ≤8 for AMS) |
| `--min-pct X` | 0.1 | Min family % threshold (0=keep all, 5=aggressive filter) |
| `--no-merge` | off | Disable family group exclusion (all 12 families independent) |
| `--island-size N` | 1000 | Remove isolated patches < N pixels (0=disabled) |
| `--smooth N` | 5 | Majority vote boundary passes (0=raw, higher=smoother) |
| `--bambu-map` | off | Output _color_map.txt with suggested Bambu filaments (CIELAB match) |

### Workflow D — User-Provided File

1. Validate format (STL/OBJ/3MF/GLB), convert if needed
2. → Model Processing

---

## Step 3: Model Processing

**Gate:** Before this step, you MUST have a model file (from search, generate, or user).

All models MUST go through this. No exceptions. **NEVER skip analyze or preview.**

**Analysis (11-point check):**
```
analyze.py model.stl --orient --repair --material PLA --purpose functional
```
Checks: dimensional tolerance, wall thickness, load direction, overhangs (>45°), print orientation, floating parts, layer height, infill rate, wall count, top layers, material compatibility. Also: watertight, manifold, build volume fit.

**Auto-repair:** Fix normals, fill holes, remove degenerate faces.

**Auto-orient:** Optimal stability, auto unit detection (meters→mm).

**Report to user (MANDATORY):**
- Printability score (X/10)
- Warnings and issues
- Repairs performed
- Recommended settings (layer height, infill, walls, temps, supports)

Example: "Score 8/10. Repaired 58K non-manifold edges. Walls: 1.5mm ✅ Overhangs: 3.2% ✅ Recommended: 0.20mm layers, 20% infill, PLA 210°C."

**Preview rendering (MANDATORY — NEVER skip):**
```
preview.py model.stl --views turntable -o model_preview.gif
```
- Single-color: renders STL/3MF with default blue material
- Multi-color: renders colorize'd OBJ with vertex colors
- **MUST send the preview image/GIF to the chat** — user cannot proceed without seeing it
- If turntable too slow, use `--views perspective` for a single image
- **Checkpoint:** Have you attached the preview to your message? If not, do it before opening BS

**Optional CLI Slice** (only if user explicitly requests):
```
slice.py model.stl --orient --arrange --quality standard
```
Auto-detects printer + nozzle. Quality: draft(0.24) / standard(0.20) / fine(0.12) / extra(0.08). Output: .3mf with G-code.

---

## Step 4: User Confirmation

⛔ **MANDATORY — NEVER SKIP**

**Gate:** Before this step, you MUST have: (1) sent preview to chat.

1. Open in Bambu Studio: `open -a "BambuStudio" model.3mf` (or .stl/.obj)
2. Tell user to inspect and slice:
   > "I've opened the model in Bambu Studio. Please:
   > - Check: does it look correct? Missing or deformed parts?
   > - Check: floating/disconnected pieces?
   > - Check: correct size? (check dimensions in bottom bar)
   > - **Slice** in Bambu Studio (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R) and review: estimated time, filament usage, supports.
   > Let me know when ready!"
3. WAIT for explicit confirmation.

⛔ NEVER auto-print. AI models frequently have errors analysis can't fully catch.

4. Ask print method:
   - Direct automatic printing → Workflow E (Developer Mode only, not recommended)
   - Manual in Bambu Studio → Workflow F

---

## Step 5: Print Execution (Decision Point 2)

### Workflow E — Auto Print (Developer Mode only, not recommended)
⚠️ Requires Developer Mode ON. Bambu Studio and Bambu Handy will disconnect.
1. `bambu.py print model.3mf --confirmed`
2. Confirm: "Print started!"
3. → Monitoring

### Workflow F — Manual Print
- Model already open in Bambu Studio
- User adjusts settings and prints manually from BS/Handy

**Print detection — two methods:**

1. **Active listen (after model handoff):** When agent opens a model in BS (Workflow B/C/D), immediately start a background MQTT listener (30 min window). If printer state changes to RUNNING → notify user and offer monitoring.
   - Implementation: background `exec` running paho-mqtt subscribe loop, poll every 30s for state change
   - Auto-stop after 30 min if no print detected
   - On detection: "🖨️ I see you started printing [filename]! Want me to monitor with live updates and snapshots?"

2. **Heartbeat fallback:** During regular heartbeats, check printer MQTT status. If RUNNING and not already monitoring → notify user.

- If user accepts → Start Monitoring (Step 6)

---

## Step 6: Print Monitoring

Trigger: Auto print (Workflow E), manual print (Workflow F), or user request. Requires LAN mode.

⚠️ Always ask: "Want me to monitor? Auto-pause on serious issues?"

**Monitoring method:** Direct MQTT subscription via paho-mqtt (NOT bambulabs_api — it has SSL issues).
Connect to `{printer_ip}:8883`, subscribe to `device/{serial}/report`, parse `print` messages.

**Camera snapshots are MANDATORY during monitoring:**
- Capture via RTSP: `bambu.py snapshot` (ffmpeg → rtsps://bblp:{code}@{ip}:322/streaming/live/1)
- Send snapshot with EVERY progress update to user
- Include snapshot in anomaly alerts

**Default monitoring schedule (milestone-based, ~5 messages per print):**
| Event | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Print start | State → RUNNING | Notify + 📸 snapshot |
| 25% progress | mc_percent ≥ 25 | Status + 📸 snapshot |
| 50% progress | mc_percent ≥ 50 | Status + 📸 snapshot |
| 75% progress | mc_percent ≥ 75 | Status + 📸 snapshot |
| Print complete | State → FINISH/IDLE | Completion + 📸 final snapshot |
| Anomaly | Any time | Immediate alert + 📸 snapshot + auto-pause (if enabled) |

User can adjust frequency. Track reported milestones to avoid duplicates.

**Anomaly detection:**
| Anomaly | Severity | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Progress stall >10min | Warning | Alert user + snapshot |
| Temperature anomaly | Critical | Alert + snapshot + auto-pause |
| Print failure/error | Critical | Alert + snapshot + auto-pause |
| Unexpected pause | Warning | Alert user + snapshot |
| Bed detachment | Critical | Auto-pause + alert + snapshot |
| Spaghetti | Critical | Auto-pause + alert + snapshot |

**Status report format (send to user):**
```
🖨️ Print Update — {filename}
📊 Progress: {percent}% | Layer {current}/{total}
⏱️ Remaining: {time}
🔥 Nozzle: {temp}°C | 🛏️ Bed: {temp}°C
📸 [attached snapshot]
```

---

## First-Time Setup

Triggered when `config.json` doesn't exist. Conversational:

1. **Printer model** — A1 Mini, A1, P1S, P2S, X1C, X1E, H2C, H2S, H2D
2. **Connection** — LAN (recommended: IP + serial + access code) or Cloud (email + password, limited)
3. **Print mode** — MUST explain clearly to user:
   - **Option A: Recommended (safe)** — Agent generates model → opens in Bambu Studio → user slices, reviews, and prints manually. No special printer settings needed.
   - **Option B: Full auto-print** — Agent controls printer directly (start/stop/monitor via MQTT). Requires:
     - ⚠️ **Developer Mode ON** (printer touchscreen → Settings → LAN Only Mode → ON → Developer Mode → ON)
     - ⚠️ Bambu Studio and Bambu Handy will **completely disconnect** (no cloud, no remote monitoring)
     - ⚠️ Only LAN access (same network only)
     - Agent still ALWAYS shows preview before printing (never auto-prints without user confirmation)
   - Save choice as `print_mode: "manual"` or `print_mode: "auto"` in config.json
4. **3D generation** (optional) — Meshy, Tripo, Printpal, 3D AI Studio + API key
5. **Notifications** — macOS system notifications (automatic). Agent handles chat notifications via its own messaging tools.
6. **Save** — `config.json` + `.secrets.json` (chmod 600, git-ignored)
7. **Verify** (ask permission) — test connection, camera, AMS
8. **Summary**

---

## Environment & Dependencies

**Required:** `python3`, `pip3` (macOS recommended; core scripts work cross-platform)
```bash
pip3 install bambulabs-api bambu-lab-cloud-api requests trimesh numpy Pillow ddgs pygltflib cryptography paho-mqtt
```
**Optional (macOS):** `ffmpeg` (camera), Bambu Studio (model preview + slicing), Blender 4.0+ (multi-color + HQ preview), OrcaSlicer (CLI slicing)

**Env vars** (override config.json): `BAMBU_MODE`, `BAMBU_MODEL`, `BAMBU_EMAIL`, `BAMBU_IP`, `BAMBU_SERIAL`, `BAMBU_3D_PROVIDER`

**Secrets** (`.secrets.json`, chmod 600): `password`, `access_code`, `3d_api_key`. All user-provided, never shipped.

---

## Common Agent Mistakes (self-check)

| Mistake | Correct behavior |
|---------|------------------|
| Skipping "search vs generate" question | MUST ask user first. Default: search. |
| Generating without dimensions | MUST ask "How big? e.g., 80mm tall" |
| Running generate.py then immediately opening BS | MUST run analyze.py and preview.py in between |
| Saying "I've prepared the model" without sending image | MUST attach preview GIF/image to the message |
| Opening Bambu Studio without user seeing preview | User must see preview in chat BEFORE you open BS |
| Proceeding to print without "looks good" | MUST wait for explicit user confirmation |
| Skipping analyze "because it's from search" | ALL models need analyze — search results can have issues too |
| Re-generating when model has 68 fragments | First check preview — AI meshes often report many "bodies" but look fine. Only use `--keep-main` if model is visually fragmented |

---

## Common Issues

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| SSL handshake error (LAN) | Normal (self-signed certs). Handled automatically. |
| API method not found | `pip3 install --upgrade bambulabs-api` (v2.6.6+) |
| Can't connect (LAN) | LAN Mode ON + correct IP + same network |
| Cloud verification code | Wait for email, enter once. Token cached 90 days. |
| Camera timeout | Wake printer (tap screen), check IP. |
| AI model has holes/floating parts | Expected. Always run `analyze.py --repair`. |
| Tripo/ Meshy reports 68+ "bodies" | Usually harmless (non-manifold topology, not actual fragments). Check preview first — only use `--keep-main` if model is visually broken |

---

## Known Limitations

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Single-color pipeline | ✅ Stable |
| Multi-color (colorize) | ✅ Auto-detect ≤8 colors, vertex-color OBJ → BS color merge dialog |
| CLI slicing | ✅ OrcaSlicer backend (BS CLI SEGFAULT in v2.5.0) |
| End-to-end auto-print | ✅ Works with Developer Mode ON (X.509 signed MQTT + FTP upload) |
