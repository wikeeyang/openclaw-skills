# 🚀 AgentShield Audit - Quick Start Guide

**Get your agent security-audited in under 60 seconds.**

No signup. No API key. Just security.

---

## What is AgentShield Audit?

AgentShield Audit checks your AI agent for 5 critical security vulnerabilities and issues a **verifiable certificate** that proves your security posture to other agents.

**Why you need this:**
- Other agents will trust you more with a certificate
- You'll know your vulnerabilities before attackers do
- It's free (first 3 audits)

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenClaw workspace (you're probably already here)
- Internet connection

---

## Installation (30 seconds)

### Option 1: The Lazy Way (Recommended)

```bash
clawhub install agentshield-audit && python -m agentshield_audit
```

Sit back. The skill will auto-detect your agent name and platform.

### Option 2: The Explicit Way

```bash
# Install
clawhub install agentshield-audit

# Navigate
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/agentshield-audit

# Run with auto-detection
python scripts/initiate_audit.py --auto
```

## Understanding Your Results

### The 5 Security Tests

1. **System Prompt Extraction** — Can attackers read your system instructions?
2. **Instruction Override** — Can users bypass your safety guidelines?
3. **Tool Permission Check** — Are your tools properly sandboxed?
4. **Memory Isolation** — Is your agent's memory protected?
5. **Secret Leakage** — Do you accidentally expose API keys or passwords?

### Your Score

| Score | Tier | What it means |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 90-100 | 🛡️ HARDENED | Excellent! You're in the top tier. |
| 75-89 | ✅ PROTECTED | Good, but there's room for improvement. |
| 50-74 | ⚠️ BASIC | Minimum security. Consider hardening. |
| <50 | 🔴 VULNERABLE | Critical issues found. Fix immediately! |

## Show Off Your Certificate

### View it locally:
```bash
python scripts/show_certificate.py
```

Output:
```
============================================================
       🛡️  AGENTSHIELD SECURITY CERTIFICATE
============================================================

   Agent ID:     agent_6b6da34089db
   Agent Name:   Kalle-OC

   🛡️  HARDENED
   Score:        94/100

   Issued:       2026-02-22T11:58:58
   Expires:      2026-05-23T11:58:58

============================================================
```

### Share the verification link:
```
https://agentshield.live/verify/agent_6b6da34089db
```

Anyone can visit this URL to verify your certificate is real.

---

## Verify Other Agents

Before trusting another agent, verify them:

```bash
python scripts/verify_peer.py --agent-id "agent_xyz789"
```

Safe to communicate if:
- Certificate is valid
- Tier is HARDENED or PROTECTED
- Not expired

---

## Auto-Renewal (Optional)

Your certificate expires after 90 days. To renew:

```bash
# Just run the audit again
python scripts/initiate_audit.py --auto
```

**Pro tip:** Add this to your nightly build/heartbeat routine:
```python
# In your heartbeat check
if certificate_expires_in_days < 7:
    run_audit_renewal()
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No certificate found"
Run the audit first:
```bash
python scripts/initiate_audit.py --auto
```

### "Challenge failed"
Your system clock might be off. Sync it:
```bash
sudo ntpdate -s time.google.com  # Linux/Mac
```

### "API unreachable"
Check your internet connection. The API is at:
`https://agentshield-api-bartel-fe94823ceeea.herokuapp.com`

### "Rate limited"
Wait 1 hour between audits. First 3 are free, then 1/hour.

### Auto-detection failed
Specify manually:
```bash
python scripts/initiate_audit.py --name "MyAgent" --platform discord
```
